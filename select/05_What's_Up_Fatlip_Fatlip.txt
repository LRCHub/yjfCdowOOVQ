Feelin' downtrodden, fresh kid turned rotten
I can't believe how naive that I've gotten
Over the years, seems like I'm gettin' dumber
Reminiscing to a time when I was younger with a hunger
Full of dreams, determination, self-esteem
But now it seems they hesitate to be on my team
You know the routine, when you winnin' they're grinnin'
All up in your face, like they was wit' you from the beginnin'
But on the flipside, when you're washed up like a riptide
Fools clown 'bout how you slipped and let shit slide
Beside the fact, my voice is wack
Clowns is runnin' 'round, talkin' 'bout I smoke crack
Ain't got no homies that got my back
Yeah, I'm a brother, but sometimes I don't feel black
My girl is white, my game ain't tight
Niggas who ain't seen me in a while be like "Dude, you aight?"
Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin'
When they be like, "What's up Fatlip?," And I say "Coolin'"
Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin'
When they be like "What's up Fatlip?," And I say "Coolin'"
Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin'
When they be like, "What's up Fatlip?," And I say "Coolin'"
Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin'
When they be like
You aight, man?
You aight, Lip?
What's up, man?
Goin' like a sucker almost every day
In the back of your mind you're probably thinkin' I was gay
But naw, I'm just a bitch-ass nigga
The type that'd get jacked if I was a rich ass nigga
See, I been a loser just about all my life
Type that tryna turn a ho into a housewife
What do you expect, I give respect
And feel for hoes niggas keep in check
I'm far from hard, emotionally scarred
On Pico Boulevard I was regarded as a retard
I make myself sick, get on my own nerves
Immature, insecure grown-up nerd
Has-been MC on a label that's unstable
Choppin' bliggy on the table
Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin'
When they be like, "What's up Fatlip?," And I say "Coolin'"
Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin'
When they be like "What's up Fatlip?," And I say "Coolin'"
Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin'
When they be like, "What's up Fatlip?," And I say "Coolin'"
Who am I kiddin', who am I foolin'
When they be like, "What's up Fatlip?"
Hey man, yeah man, what's up wid' it
I still got it
Yeah yeah, I been workin' on my step
Hey check this out, y'all, check this out
She keeps on
She keeps on
I still got it
