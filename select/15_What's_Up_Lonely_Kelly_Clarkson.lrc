[00:07.44] Oooh oooh
[00:13.00] Blue, I'm gettin' kind of close to you
[00:19.01] Like a shadow I can't lose
[00:22.69] Hey, you've been hanging with me everyday
[00:43.19] 
[00:29.91] Now you're gettin' in my way
[00:33.52] I know you understand me
[00:38.20] But don't you think maybe it's time to move on
[01:01.20] 
[00:43.63] What's up lonely?
[00:47.45] Seems you're my only friend who wants to share my pain
[00:54.50] Tell me heartache, what's it gonna take
[01:00.02] For you to leave me alone today
[01:15.52] 
[01:04.93] Just when I think that you're gone
[01:08.15] You're in the mirror looking back at me
[01:12.62] So what's up lonely?
[01:15.96] Lonely, ooh
[01:21.46] 
[01:23.60] Sometimes,I wish you weren't by my side
[01:31.09] Can't you find another shoulder
[01:34.25] 'Cause I, I wanna leave this broken heart behind
[01:58.25] 
[01:41.28] We're both wasting too much time
[01:44.99] Find someone else to rain on
[01:49.65] I'm really gettin' tired of singing this sad song
[02:14.15] 
[01:56.14] What's up lonely?
[01:58.44] Seems you're my only friend who wants to share my pain
[02:06.14] Tell me heartache, what's it gonna take

[02:24.01] So what's up lonely?
[02:34.01] 
[02:28.57] Don't wanna give you a reason
[02:32.62] To hang around anymore
[02:38.32] You won't be hurting my feelings
[02:42.84] If you find another broken heart
[02:46.46] You can lean on
[02:53.96] 
[02:50.97] Gotta go, gotta move on
[02:53.99] Gotta go, gotta move on
